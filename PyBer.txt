The first observation which seems to be the most obvious is that Urban areas are incredibly more busy than the rest.
The second obesrvation was that the highest fares for rides ocurred in the rural city type, probably due to the longer distance needing to be covered per fair.
The third observation was that on average the suburban rides seemed to cost more than the other 2 city types.
